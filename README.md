# Wellcome to CLAMM
A Cluster Expansion and Monte Carlo toolkit for Alloys and Magnetic Materials 

CLAMM consists of three main tools:
- `CLAMM_Prep` (Python): Prepares DFT simulation data
- `CLAMM_Fit` (Python): Fits lattice and spin-lattice models
- `CLAMM_MC` (C++): Runs Monte Carlo simulations on fitted models
